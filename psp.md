# What Is The Pump Scheduling Problem?
### By Mahirul Islam

The **Pump Scheduling Problem (PSP)** is fundamentally a mathematical problem in **optimisation**, aiming to find the best sequence of operations for pumps, valves and other systems in a **Water Distribution Network (WDN)**, to meet water demand, at a minimal cost, while optionally satisfying other **constraints**, such as pipe pressure, energy usage, carbon emissions, etc.
