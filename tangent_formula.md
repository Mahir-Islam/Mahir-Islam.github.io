# Hassan's Tangent Formula

For a circle of the form $$(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2$$, what is the formula for the tangent around such circle at degree $$\theta$$?

TLDR; it's: $$y = \tan(\theta)(x - a) + \sec(\theta)r + b$$.
I couldn't find any information about this specific formula, so I'm claiming it for myself! I'll call it Hassan's formula. Now, why is that?
